# Cursor Rules for @jsdev-store

## Hook Dependencies
- Never include `appApi` or any of its properties (like `appApi.admin`) in React hook dependency arrays
- appApi instances are stable and don't need to be included in useEffect, useMemo, useCallback dependencies
- Use empty dependency array `[]` instead when appApi is the only dependency

## Examples
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Don't do this
useEffect(() => {
  appApi.admin.getStoreClients().then(handleResponse);
}, [appApi.admin]);

// ✅ Good - Do this instead  
useEffect(() => {
  appApi.admin.getStoreClients().then(handleResponse);
}, []);
```

## Reasoning
appApi is a stable API instance that doesn't change between renders, so including it in dependencies creates unnecessary re-runs and potential infinite loops.
